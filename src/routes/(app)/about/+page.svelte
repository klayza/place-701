		My name is Clayton Wieberg, I am a software enginner, aspiring entrepreneur, and an independent student. In the {age} years I've been around, I achieved the Eagle Scout rank at age 16, became scuba certified at 17, got my dream job as a software developer at 19, flew solo to Japan for a rave (<a href="https://www.tano-c.net/">Tano*C</a>), and converted a van to travel the pacific west coast of the United States at 20.

		I began working at 15 when I started a trash management service for my neigborhood. At 16 I got my first job at an italian restaurant where I could start making 'real' money. After highschool, I got a fulltime job at a semiconductor fab where I got to take part in the magical process which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithography">lithography</a>. From there, I got my first professional job as a software engineer at a local credit union. After a year of saving and mentoring from probably one of the most wise and coolest employers ever, I decided it was time to quit my job and pursue a career as an entrepreneur. Currently, I am self-studying a wide range of sciences as well as business to support my professional endeavors.

		Outside of work I like to tinker with fun <a href="/projects">projects</a> such as web development, simluation, cellular automata, web scrapers, AI assistants, and user design. I like to read about scifi and philosophy late at night. My favorite movies are Tron, Dune, Her, and Bladerunner 2077. Occasionally I play games like Satisfactory, Factorio, Minecraft (modded), Stellaris, and Terraria. Rhythm games are somewhat an addiction for me... I play Beat Saber, Osu!, and Sound Voltex.
