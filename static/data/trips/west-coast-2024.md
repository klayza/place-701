## Day 1 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Arizona -> Los Angeles</p>

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0429-desert.jpg">

My first stop was L.A. and my van's first long range test. I'd be driving for 6 hours through the sonoran desert. Not much else to say, it's just an empty desert.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0429-canadian.jpg">

Eventually stopped at a rest station to make some <a href="/recipes/canadian-pizza">canadian pizza</a> for lunch.

<img style="width: 40%; height: auto; margin: auto;" src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0429-longboard.jpg">


Finally I arrived in L.A. and looked for a place to stay. 

In the van dwelling community pretty much everyone uses an app called iOverlander which shows you where other people have camped and how safe, quiet, and etc. a 'camping' spot is. It has been extremely useful for me. 

So I finally found a quiet spot right in the heart of downtown L.A. (yet to realize I was a street over from skid row), hopped out and took out my longboard to go for a ride. It was about 10pm by now so there weren't too many people out.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0429-dinner.jpg">

Took a ride through ghettoville and found a general store to get some ingredients for tonight's dinner. Just got some simple ingredients, mushroom, chicken, sriracha.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0429-cooking.jpg">

Watched an episode of the new Fallout show that I downloaded before, ate dinner and hit the sack. First day done!



## Day 2
Today was my first full day in L.A. and I had a few places that I wanted to visit.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-start.jpg">

This is where I stayed the night.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-la.jpg">

Took a drive through L.A. street to get a workout in and shower at Planet Fitness.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-usc.jpg">

Rode my longboard to University of Southern California and got some breakfast at Cafe Dulce. A California breakfast burrito is easily one of the most vital food items apart of a healthy diet. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-usc2.jpg">

Checked out the campus and talked to a few of the students there. For a university in silicon valley I just had to get their opinon on AI. Mixed views, to be expected. In the future I will have to come back here and run some surveys for business research. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-aquarium.jpg">

Went to California Science Center. Super cool 3,000 gallon aquarium. Spent like an hour in their space exhibit.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-van.jpg">

*Home sweet home.*

<img style="width: 50%;" src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-misspiggy.jpg">

Rode my longboard to Santa Monica Pier and saw this lady. She was super viral on TikTok a while ago. Too bad I didn't get to see her act. (Her act: get down on all fours, run up to people and scare them.) Might be even funnier watching her talk like a normal person right after her show.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-venicecanal.jpg">

Riding through the Venice canals. Saw some nice houses.

<img style="width: 50%;" src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-icecream.jpg">

So freaking good. Fruit and plain vanilla ice cream is seriously underrated. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-reservation.jpg">

Where I stayed for the night. Super quiet here, slept like a baby.



## Day 3
Today I *had* the goal of doing a catch and cook. The most I got was a new frustration for tying fishing knots and a sunburn. Besides that it was a beautiful day.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-1.jpg">

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-2.jpg">

Watching fishing tutorials and listening to music out on the rocks. Was pretty nice actually. 

The sun beat down on me pretty bad though cause when I got back I passed out for a few hours.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-33.jpg">

Afterwards I rode around downtown Venice for a bit. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-3.jpg">

Made some hamburger helper and I was happy. Shortly had a heart attack afterwards.

## Day 4

Today was attempt two at a catch and cook. Spoiler alert, didn't happen.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-1.jpg">

Not paying a single penny in rent and I'm less than a 5 minute walk away from the beach. Fight me L.A. homeowners

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-3.jpg">

All around L.A. you see lots of mural art. Usually cultural or based on a public figure. But this was different. Abstract. Made me want to surf. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-2.jpg">

Walking to the pier. I can't wait to catch a fish!

<div class="text-center text-xl my-12 italic">2 hours later ...</div>

My fishing rod is broken. Nice. Don't underestimate those razor clams on the pier supports, they will always win. At least it was fun watching the elderly asian people reel in fish by the minute.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-4.jpg">

I needed a way to vent my frustration. After a long and hard morning of staring out at the sea waiting for literally anything to happen I decided I was going to sit down and get some work done. (This place is called The Cow's Rear End Cafe. And despite it's name it's my favorite place to chill in Venice Beach)

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-5.jpg">

Skating through Venice beach to Santa Monica Pier.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-6.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-7.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-8.jpg">

JAPAN AND HOTDOGS! JAPAN + HOTDOG = JAPADOG! SO UNQIUE, LET'S SPEND $15 ON A HOTDOG! 

It's absolutely worth it. 

## Day 5

This was my last day in L.A. and I thought I would visit one last place before heading up north.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-getty.jpg">

The Getty is an art musesum open to the public for completely free. 

(Although they do charge you $25 if you use their parking lot for longer than an hour. Speedran their exhibits in 58 minutes, no joke)

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-gettyfancy.jpg">

Not much of an art guy but it was cool seeing the French interior. *Wonder how many people see this stuff and say to themselves they want this in their house?*

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-bricks.jpg">

Bricks.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-sunset.jpg">

And it's time to head towards Yosemite!

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-backroads.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-entrance.jpg">

It got dark really, really fast. Like pitch dark. So driving through the middle of a pitch black forest in the middle of the night was interesting.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-creepy.jpg">



## Day 6 <p class="inline text-gray-700  font-thin">Sequoia National Park</p>

> 07:24<br><br>Chilling deep in the woods. No internet. Just made my coffee. Feels good man. <br><br> So last night was one to remember. I drove for about an hour and a half through a dark forest, no internet, no music, just silence. It was surreal. Sometimes I would stop to double check my navigation and flip off the lights leaving me in complete darkness, and when I turned them back on, I felt like anything could appear out of the dim headlights. I saw like 2 cars driving in the hour and half of driving. No one else. Saw some streams, not much else though. I started doubting if the moon really existed cause of how terrifyingly dark it was. <br><br> I think the woods can be as scary as you want them to be. I didn’t get a chance to look at the stars last night due to the voice in my head yelling: “GET BACK IN THE CAR NOW! SHUT THE DOOR FAST! SOMETHING IS COMING!!!”, but I’ll have another chance. <br><br> Also, insight. This goes off of what the author from Atomic Habits talks about with ‘primal’ needs. Humans are afraid of the dark. That’s why we sell tech to muffle this fear. “Come stay here in Phoenix! Never be in the dark again!”, says every modern city ever. Of course no city explicitly advertises light, but it’s subliminal. I imagine some cities in the last few hundred years advertised exactly this, so what if we apply this to modern day? What primal need can we satiate now or in the near future that wasn’t possible until now? Well, first of all ...  

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-1.jpg">

Finally! This was the view I was looking forward to. There was a stream that I checked out a little down the hill. Some deep snow too. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-2.jpg">

Felt good to finally put my popup table to use. Made some ham and spinach quesadillas for breakfast. 

There were 4 other campers there who likely used the same app I did to find this spot. All of them were heading up north and of the four I got one person's number and we have been exchanging some cool places to visit ever since. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-3.jpg">

Heading out to my next stop. (There were snow warnings so I had to GTFO)

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-cathaven.jpg">

Project Survival: Cat Haven is an organization that cares for endangered wild big cats. ~~Fun~~ Sad fact: their Bengal tiger was on the Joe Exotic show.

They have over 18 big cats such as a bobcat, Canada lynx, caracal, cheetah, clouded leopard, cougar, Eurasian lynx, jaguar, leopard, lion, Pallas cat, snow leopard, and a serval.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-4.jpg">


<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-5.jpg">

The snow leopards were my favorite...

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-6.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-7.jpg">

Definitely a cat.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-8.jpg">

Cat too.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0504-9.jpg">

This cute fella wasn't on the Joe Exotic show but the orange one was. The tour guide gave a demonstration of what happens when you turn your back to a big cat. Amazing how silent their padded feet make them considering they weighh on average 500 pounds. 

After Cat Haven I headed to Fresno. Where I'd stock up before heading to Yosemite!

## Day 7 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0505-1.jpg">

My solar panels were quite happy today. No more clouds!

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0505-2.jpg">

Getting some work done at Starbucks.  

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0505-3.jpg">

Found myself in a car meetup! There were lots of low riders and hydraulic rigs crusing around town. Loud, blaring mariacha music. The people there were very friendly. Talked to a local and turns out this happens almost every week! (Cinco de Mayo was a contributing factor)

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0505-4.jpg">

Celebrated Cinco de Mayo with an al pastor quesadilla. And... The Office. 

## Day 8

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-1.jpg">

Driving to Yosemite. 

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5W3cjX2J3tjhG8zb6u0qHn?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
<br>
Good song to listen to rolling through the hills. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-2.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-3.jpg">

Bridalveil falls |>

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-4.jpg">

Found another one of my species! She goes by <a href="https://instagram.com/_catmobile_">Cat Mobile</a> and yep there are cats in there. Two of them. And they like to go on walks! I'd be scared of hawks though...

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-5.jpg">

There wasn't too many people out here on Monday so it was nice to sit and just listen. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-6.jpg">

Yosemite falls can be heard throughout the valley. It's relentless during the spring. There's a constant hum to the falls beating down on the rocks below that sticks with you even once it's out of range.  

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-7.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-8.jpg">

"A Walmart Supercenter would look great here!" - The internet

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-9.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0506-10.jpg">

There was like 10 other van lifers down here just outside of Yosemite. Making spaghetti. 

## Day 9

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-1.jpg">

This routine of waking up and looking outside my home-on-wheels-with-zero-rent at a completely jaw dropping view is honestly pretty amazing. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-2.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-3.jpg">

No, please! Don't peck at my wires! You can't make a nest out of that!

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-4.jpg">

First hike and we are at Vernal Falls. A light 3 mile hike with just an extraordianry climb through a mossy forest and alongside the raging Merced river. During the last stretch you are climbing these large blocky granite steps while being misted by the falls which is about 100 feet away. The moss growth near the walls were very pretty as well.  

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-5.jpg">

A light snack of Ritz crackers and tuna. Not exactly my top pick but their cheeze whiz was $8! Maybe it was for the best... and a few more years of my life...

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-6.jpg">

The trail (Mist Trail) keeps going all the way to Half Dome (Yosemite's most well known mountain). Too bad it was closed.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-7.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-8.jpg">

Finally back and managed to score a camping spot. Having some more avocado toast. You know as they say: When in Rome, Do a... (point made) 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-9.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-10.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0507-11.jpg">

Slept like a baby.

## Day 10

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-1.jpg">

I am just not getting sick of this stuff. This is like the 9th ham and spinach quesadilla I've had this trip. Another van lifer I met said he ate fajitas for dinner every night for a month straight.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-2.jpg">

This has got to be my **favorite** view of Yosemite. For two reasons. 
 1. It's massive and makes me feel like an ant.
 2. It's distinct black streaks of varnish.

Jacob Geller, a Youtuber who creates video essays about video games that go surprisingly deep, made a video that's called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDrHpmkL4rY">Three Specific Kinds of Terror</a>. One of the fears is about big things. And of course I wasn't trembling or anything at the sight of a mountain, but he does speak about some rather profound ideas. I won't explain too much but I'd just like to leave this here.


<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-3.jpg">

The varnish is actually a thin layer of minerals and organic matter that accumulates on the surface of rocks over long periods and are stained by flowing water.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-4.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-5.jpg">

Half dome |>

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-6.jpg">

About halfway through my hike to Yosemite point. 2 miles and 1,200 more feet to climb!  

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-7.jpg">



<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-8.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-9.jpg">

Wallpaper material right here.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-10.jpg">
Never would have seen the mountain ranges from the valley or even driving through. The 4 mile hike up was well worth the price of admission.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-11.jpg">

Had some lunch here. This totally beats every other place I've eaten at. The only places that could top this would be The Tree of Souls from Avatar or the bow of the Titanic, neither of which exists... VR will get there one day.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-12.jpg">

There was another trail that went along around the cliffsides called Panoroma trail. It required backpacking gear and a permit though. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-13.jpg">


<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-14.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-15.jpg">

8 miles and 4k feet climbed. Clocking out for today...

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-16.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-17.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0508-18.jpg">

The river rapids were comforting to fall asleep to. 

## Day 11 

Heading out to San Francisco next. I could totally spend a week or two here but I need some backpacking gear if I want to do any of the 'better' hikes.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0509-1.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0509-2.jpg">

These rolling hills were beautiful. I can totally imagine a golden retriever prancing through these fields.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0509-3.jpg">

Got to San Jose late at night around 11pm and was surprised at how many shops were still open. Night life is so underrated. Tokyo had it figured out.

## Day 12

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0510-1.jpg">

Getting some work done in a vibrant coffee shop called Red Rock coffee. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0510-2.jpg">

This was in Palo Alto. Lots of asian shops.

While I was here working a lady sitting next to me noticed my shirt which only had Japanese characters on it (日本語は話せません). It reads "I don't speak Japanese", which is true but I can read and speak a little. She happened to be studying Japanese literature and was just a treasure chest of knowledge on things like getting a tutor, and how to live and travel Japan cheaply. All of which might be what I do after this trip.     

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0510-museum.jpg">

Finally at the computer history museum! 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0510-3.jpg">

The world of computing is pretty amazing, especially in the field of programming. At some points in design you will find yourself lost in a space of abstraction. A space where anything can be molded from the abstract. It's not just an idea or a thought, but a blob of truth. It must be felt and imagined at all angles, and decorated with interpretation. And only once this snippet of truth is etched into silicon and assigned a computer, can you can build something amazing. Whether it be a device to record biological signals or a simple redstone mechanism in Minecraft, each stems from a common truth. 

Read "The Beginning of Infinity" for more... in case that wasn't enough.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0510-4.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0510-5.jpg">

Hacker Dojo - where software developers, entrepreneurs and alike come to collaborate and break things. 

## Day 13

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0511-1.jpg">

Most silicon valley banner ever.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0511-2.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0511-3.jpg">

This was an amazing cafe called Blue Bottle Coffee that had a really good space for working. 

## Day 14


<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0512-1.jpg">

Super super good book that I happened to be reading at the same time as this guy. I also told him that. (This felt like one of those times where you see someone wearing the exact same t-shirt as you) 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0512-2.jpg">

Third day in San Francsico and yet again at another coffee shop. Like what else is there to do here? 

## Day 15

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0513-1.jpg">

For the past few days I've been hanging out around south San Francisco. Today I would go right into the heart of downtown and pray I wouldn't have my windows bashed in (because you are reading this they weren't).

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0513-2.jpg">

Coffee time. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0513-3.jpg">

Downtown Chinatown. Couldn't help getting some milk tea. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0513-4.jpg">

SF has 23 historic cable cars which date back to the 1870s. Pretty special huh?

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0513-5.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0513-6.jpg">

## Day 16

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0514-1.jpg">

Thought it'd be safer to leave my vehicle as far away from downtown as possible. But how do I get there without a vehicle?

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0514-2.jpg">

Public transportation! Got a ride to Golden Gate park, the third-most visited urban park in the United States. Huge too, at 1,017 acres.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0514-3.jpg">

This was the vibe throughout the park. Spent a good chunk of my day here.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0514-4.jpg">

Somewhat creepy yet beautiful medieval looking bridge.

## Day 17

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0515-1.jpg">

Getting groceries from my favorite grocery store! (As long as there are things I cannot pronounce I'm into it)

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0515-2.jpg">

Today, I started my introduction into <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics">physics</a> and <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/philosophy">philosophy</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://www.susanrigetti.com/">Susan Rigetti</a> for her comprehensive and thoughtful guides on learning each of these subjects in depth. 

For anyone reading this that is even remotely interested in learning something I highly reccommend you do and dig a little deeper into that one thing that's been popping in and out of your head.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0515-3.jpg">

Brain food.

## Day 18

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0516-1.jpg">

Today was another coffee shop day. Saw this huge doggo keeping watch over the neighborhood.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0516-2.jpg">

Cozy night walk through a park.

## Day 19

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0517-1.jpg">

Slept right next to the beach. And 30 feet away from a coffee shop!

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0517-2.jpg">

This spot called Chit Chat Coffee was a coffee lover's paradise. (How many times have I said coffee now?) Super fast wifi, free refills, and right next to the beach. 

This sandwich went hard. Sourdough, egg, and tomato. That's it! Fresh tomato and eggs is crazy underrated.

Downloading the entirety of Wikipedia as well.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0517-3.jpg">

Lunch on the coast.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0517-4.jpg">

Homemade fries and avocado. Absolutely drenched in ketchup after taking this photo.

## Day 20

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-1.jpg">

Chickpeas, quinoa, golden curry, and spinach. Needed brain fuel for navigating through the dense traffic of San Francisco. (It was not sufficient. At least 5 energy drinks would've done the trick.)

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-2.jpg">

Is this foreshadowing something? Is my van going to get impaled during a pride event?

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-3.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-4.jpg">

Overcast was here all week unfortunately. The red was barely visible so used a filter to take advantage of the clouds and it turned out looking like it was taken in the 70's. Pretty neat.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-5.jpg">

Who designed this car and gave it a gotee?!  

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-6.jpg">

Pacific highway at last!

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-7.jpg">

Needed to find a place to crash for the night... hm, that phrase doesn't work if you live in a car.

Headed inland a bit to look for some campsites.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-8.jpg">

Driving thrugh clouds.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-9.jpg">

Right before the sun faded below the clouds I got a short glimpse of easily the most beautiful sunsets of my life.  

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-10.jpg">

As soon as the sun disappeared I felt like I was driving through a horror movie set.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0518-12.png">


## Day 21

Felt good to be out of the city again. I camped about 30 miles from the coast on some old logging road.

Lounged about all day here, reading, coding, eating. One benefit to having a small van, or rather home, is that you don't need to physically move! It's got a kitchen, outlet, bed, closet, pantry, all within arm's reach. Got to be careful though, if I don't move enough I will end up like Peter Griffin in the episode he lived in a food truck. (He had to be lifted out with a crane after a week)

Found this fella and a few of his siblings in the creek next to where I was staying.

Californian staple food.

An insightful book about the problems of smarter-than-human computers. To sum it up, it's not looking good for us. So remember to use your please and thank you's when talking to ChatGPT and you might be spared!

I finally caught him! It wasn't that hard, actually. They move as slowly and non-chalantly as people do in hot tubs.

It's called a Rough-skinned Newt. Fun fact they are toxic. Only if you put them in your mouth. (I didn't)

## Day 23

Thanks to the sun I would be able to watch The Office. From the moment sunlight photons strike the photovoltaic cells in my solar panels, they are converted into electrical energy via the photovoltaic effect. This direct current (DC) is then routed through an inverter, converting it to alternating current (AC), which travels along conductive cables to my computer's power supply. Here, the electrical energy is utilized to power the computer's circuits, enabling the digital processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU) to decode and reassemble binary data into coherent video frames, which are ultimately rendered on the display screen as the show "The Office."

Beyond the dirt lot I was comfortably parked on was a 70ft cliff into sharp ocean rock. Wouldn't even complain if I woke up in the middle of the night to hear my breaks go out and realize I forgot the parking brake... cause that view is killer.

There is this thing I like to do that helps for remembering settings like this. It's kind of like a meditation. You go through all five of your senses and focus on each of them. What do you see? Hear? Smell? Feel? Taste? It's proven worthwhile since I started doing it as a kid.

Avenue of the giants road. 10/10, felt like an ant.
