## Day 1

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0429-desert.jpg">

My first stop was L.A. and my van's first long range test. I'd be driving for 6 hours through the sonoran desert. Not much else to say, it's just an empty desert.

Eventually stopped at a rest station to make some <a href="/recipes/canadian-pizza">canadian pizza</a> for lunch.

Finally I arrived in L.A. and looked for a place to stay. 

In the van dwelling community pretty much everyone uses an app called iOverlander which shows you where other people have camped and how safe, quiet, and etc. a 'camping' spot is. It has been extremely useful for me. 

So I finally found a quiet spot right in the heart of downtown L.A. (yet to realize I was a street over from skid row), hopped out and took out my longboard to go for a ride. It was about 10pm by now so there weren't too many people out.

Took a ride through ghettoville and found a general store to get some ingredients for tonight's dinner. Just got some simple ingredients, mushroom, chicken, sriracha.

Watched an episode of the new Fallout show that I downloaded before, ate dinner and hit the sack. First day done!



## Day 2
Today was my first full day in L.A. and I had a few places that I wanted to visit.

This is where I stayed the night.

Took a drive through L.A. street to get a workout in and shower at Planet Fitness.

Rode my longboard to University of Southern California and got some breakfast at Cafe Dulce. A California breakfast burrito is easily one of the most vital food items apart of a healthy diet.

Checked out the campus and talked to a few of the students there. For a university in silicon valley I just had to get their opinon on AI. Mixed views, to be expected. In the future I will have to come back here and run some surveys for business research.

Went to California Science Center. Super cool 3,000 gallon aquarium. Spent like an hour in their space exhibit.

*Home sweet home.*

Rode my longboard to Santa Monica Pier and saw this lady. She was super viral on TikTok a while ago. Too bad I didn't get to see her act. (Her act: get down on all fours, run up to people and scare them.) Might be even funnier watching her talk like a normal person right after her show.

Riding through the Venice canals. Saw some nice houses.

<img style="width: 50%;" src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-icecream.jpg">

So freaking good. Fruit and plain vanilla ice cream is seriously underrated.

Where I stayed for the night. Super quiet here, slept like a baby.



## Day 3
Today I *had* the goal of doing a catch and cook. The most I got was a new frustration for tying fishing knots and a sunburn. Besides that it was a beautiful day.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-2.jpg">

Watching fishing tutorials and listening to music out on the rocks. Was pretty nice actually. 

The sun beat down on me pretty bad though cause when I got back I passed out for a few hours.

Afterwards I rode around downtown Venice for a bit.

Made some hamburger helper and I was happy. Shortly had a heart attack afterwards.

## Day 4

Today was attempt 2 at a catch and cook. Spoiler alert, didn't happen.
