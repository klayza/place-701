## Day 1

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0429-desert.jpg">

My first stop was L.A. and my van's first long range test. I'd be driving for 6 hours through the sonoran desert. Not much else to say, it's just an empty desert.

Eventually stopped at a rest station to make some <a href="/recipes/canadian-pizza">canadian pizza</a> for lunch.

Finally I arrived in L.A. and looked for a place to stay. 

In the van dwelling community pretty much everyone uses an app called iOverlander which shows you where other people have camped and how safe, quiet, and etc. a 'camping' spot is. It has been extremely useful for me. 

So I finally found a quiet spot right in the heart of downtown L.A. (yet to realize I was a street over from skid row), hopped out and took out my longboard to go for a ride. It was about 10pm by now so there weren't too many people out.

Took a ride through ghettoville and found a general store to get some ingredients for tonight's dinner. Just got some simple ingredients, mushroom, chicken, sriracha.

Watched an episode of the new Fallout show that I downloaded before, ate dinner and hit the sack. First day done!



## Day 2
Today was my first full day in L.A. and I had a few places that I wanted to visit.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-start.jpg">

This is where I stayed the night.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-la.jpg">

Took a drive through L.A. street to get a workout in and shower at Planet Fitness.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-usc.jpg">

Rode my longboard to University of Southern California and got some breakfast at Cafe Dulce. A California breakfast burrito is easily one of the most vital food items apart of a healthy diet. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-usc2.jpg">

Checked out the campus and talked to a few of the students there. For a university in silicon valley I just had to get their opinon on AI. Mixed views, to be expected. In the future I will have to come back here and run some surveys for business research. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-aquarium.jpg">

Went to California Science Center. Super cool 3,000 gallon aquarium. Spent like an hour in their space exhibit.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-van.jpg">

*Home sweet home.*

<img style="width: 50%;" src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-misspiggy.jpg">

Rode my longboard to Santa Monica Pier and saw this lady. She was super viral on TikTok a while ago. Too bad I didn't get to see her act. (Her act: get down on all fours, run up to people and scare them.) Might be even funnier watching her talk like a normal person right after her show.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-venicecanal.jpg">

Riding through the Venice canals. Saw some nice houses.

<img style="width: 50%;" src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-icecream.jpg">

So freaking good. Fruit and plain vanilla ice cream is seriously underrated. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0430-reservation.jpg">

Where I stayed for the night. Super quiet here, slept like a baby.



## Day 3
Today I *had* the goal of doing a catch and cook. The most I got was a new frustration for tying fishing knots and a sunburn. Besides that it was a beautiful day.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-1.jpg">

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-2.jpg">

Watching fishing tutorials and listening to music out on the rocks. Was pretty nice actually. 

The sun beat down on me pretty bad though cause when I got back I passed out for a few hours.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-33.jpg">

Afterwards I rode around downtown Venice for a bit. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0501-3.jpg">

Made some hamburger helper and I was happy. Shortly had a heart attack afterwards.

## Day 4

Today was attempt two at a catch and cook. Spoiler alert, didn't happen.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-1.jpg">

Not paying a single penny in rent and I'm less than a 5 minute walk away from the beach. Fight me L.A. homeowners

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-3.jpg">

All around L.A. you see lots of mural art. Usually cultural or based on a public figure. But this was different. Abstract. Made me want to surf. 

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-2.jpg">

Walking to the pier. I can't wait to catch a fish!

<div class="text-center text-xl my-12 italic">2 hours later ...</div>

My fishing rod is broken. Nice. Don't underestimate those razor clams on the pier supports, they will always win. At least it was fun watching the elderly asian people reel in fish by the minute.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-4.jpg">

I needed a way to vent my frustration. After a long and hard morning of staring out at the sea waiting for literally anything to happen I decided I was going to sit down and get some work done. (This place is called The Cow's Rear End Cafe. And despite it's name it's my favorite place to chill in Venice Beach)

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-5.jpg">

Skating through Venice beach to Santa Monica Pier.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-6.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-7.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0502-8.jpg">

JAPAN AND HOTDOGS! JAPAN + HOTDOG = JAPADOG! SO UNQIUE, LET'S SPEND $15 ON A HOTDOG! 

It's absolutely worth it. 

## Day 5

This was my last day in L.A. and I thought I would visit one last place before heading up north.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-getty.jpg">

The Getty is an art musesum open to the public for completely free. 

(Although they do charge you $25 if you use their parking lot for longer than an hour. Speedran their exhibits in 58 minutes, no joke)

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-gettyfancy.jpg">

Not much of an art guy but it was cool seeing the French interior. *Wonder how many people see this stuff and say to themselves they want this in their house?*

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-bricks.jpg">

Bricks.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-sunset.jpg">

And it's time to head towards Yosemite!

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-backroads.jpg">
<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0503-entrance.jpg">

It got dark really, really fast. Like pitch dark. So driving through the middle of a pitch black forest in the middle of the night was interesting.
