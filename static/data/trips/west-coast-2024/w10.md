Today I'm doing a hike along the coast. It's about 5 miles there an back.

This is the first time I'd done a hike on the beach. It was so cool. Occasionally I would see a few jagged rocks sticking out of the sand and there would be sealife around it.

Oh this is going to be fun...

Just keeps getting better!

Finally got to the top! Beautiful views all around.

These are limpets, and you can eat them. Apparently they don't taste bad, but I don't know if I can trust the starving man in the survival shows.

These guys are like landmines, you DO NOT want to step on them. Luckily I saw him in time so he got to participate in the photoshoot.

## Day 64 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Maymere Falls</p>

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0726-1.jpg">

Did a small hike today, super crowded though. It's really hard to enjoy a hike when there is so much noise and commotion going on around you. Wasn't my favorite.

## Day 65 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Hurricane Hill</p>

Camped overnight right before the entrance to Olympic National Park.

I had heard good things about this trail so I wanted to get an early start before the hordes of people started flooding in.

The sun started to flow into the valley.

Depression cured.

I gotta say, this place left me in awe. Before I started all of this traveling I saw this instagram video of someone around my age in a place like this, talking about living life completely free. It sort of stuck with me. About 5 months later and I am where the guy was standing. This was one of those moments where you know you will become nostalgic for this very point in time in the future. A wave of clarity washed over me. All of the fear or doubt I had in the beginning was justified, and it felt amazing.

Silly mistake, I didn't have enough fuel to make it to the next gas station. Luckily I was on a hill, so I can just roll down, right? Not really. By the time I got to the bottom my breaks were starting to smoke. So yep, lesson learned. Got to a gas station without having to push my car like a dunce.

Made it to Port Angeles.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0727-12.jpg">

I got to town at the perfect time because there was a farmers market.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0727-13.jpg">

Tasted like home ðŸ˜­.

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0727-14.jpg">

Found a cozy coffee shop and did some work.

## Day 66 <p class="inline text-gray-700 ">Victoria, CA</p>

<img src="/img/trips/west-coast-2024/0728-1.jpg">

Got some good rest because today was going to be long. I was heading to Victoria.
